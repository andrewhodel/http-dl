http-dl - a never-fail http downloader

# ABOUT

When living in various places on the globe with poor Internet connections I grew tired of wget, curl and other http downloaders constantly requiring a manual restart of the program due to various network conditions.

I built this to never fail no matter the situation, as long as the server supports Range requests it will get your file.

# COMPILING

Build with gcc <5.0 or use C89 with your compiler.  C99 at least with clang doesn't work with gethostbyname, one day I'll add getaddrinfo and gai_strerror.
	gcc -o http-dl http-dl.c

# USAGE

Just run the program with the url:
	./http-dl http://server/filename
	./http-dl http://server:port/filename

# TODO

Add https support.
